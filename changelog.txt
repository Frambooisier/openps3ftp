- Reverted removal of APPE command.
- Added some additional standard FTP commands.
- Rewrote server engine to be able to compile on Linux, CELL, and PSL1GHT.
  * This makes for easier debugging, so this release should be expected to
    perform much better (and hopefully bug-free) than earlier versions.
  * With the new codebase, developers can now easily add their own commands
    without having to worry about affecting the server engine. The command
    system is now designed to be "plugin-based".
- Removed asynchronous IO. No real benefits were found after thorough testing.
- Vastly improved stability of multiple connections.
  * 10 simultaneous connections in FileZilla is tested to be stable!
- Fixed a bad bug in 4.1 causing connections to drop when downloading files.

- Removed support for APPE command.
- Implemented a new simple UI.
- Source can now be compiled as a PSL1GHT static library.
- Source can now be compiled as a CELLSDK static library.
- Implemented asynchronous IO writing. May improve stability in some cases.
  * By default, this is disabled. You can toggle this using the command "AIO".
- Implemented internal IO caching. May improve performance in some cases.
- Improved single-file transfer performance compared to previous versions.
- Slightly improved transfer performance when using multiple connections.
- Implemented additional error checking to prevent potential crashes.
- Fixed most if not all instances of "completed" stuck file transfers.
- Fixed a long-standing bug that caused the network stack to crash when
  performing a large number of data operations in a short amount of time.
  * This bug apparently exists on all current FTP homebrew servers.
