- multiMAN
- webMAN
- IRISMAN
- Rebug Toolbox

Developers:
- By default, the Makefile compiles for Linux. This can be changed by setting
  the make variable SDK to either PSL1GHT or CELL.
- The 'bin' directory contains examples that help integrate the library into
  your own program.
- Questions/need support? Create an "Issue" on the GitHub repo.

Users:
- There are two builds included in a standard distribution: CEX and REX.
  CEX is usable on (O/C)FW 3.40 to 3.55, and REX is for any CFW 3.56+.

Future Plans:
- SPRX/VSH plugin.
