OpenPS3FTP version 3.0 README
=============================

OpenPS3FTP is an open source FTP server for the PlayStation 3. It supports
	the basic FTP commands that the typical user would need to transfer files
	in and out of their console.

OpenPS3FTP is built using libraries from the PSL1GHT SDK (commit 534e589).

As of version 3.0:
- It has been blind-rewritten from scratch, with C++. The meaning of
	"blind-rewritten" is that all the code that I have written has NOT been
	tested by me at all. The reason for this is because I no longer have
	access to homebrew functionality on my own console. That said, I trust my
	own skills in writing good code. Some of the code is based on previous
	versions, and some are based on new knowledge and pre-tested code. If
	somehow this program does not work, please contact me with much detail so
	that I can look into it for you. Also, feel free to participate in the
	development of OpenPS3FTP on the GitHub repository. :)
- The source code is now on the "Beerware" license, instead of GNU GPL. You
	can do whatever you want with the code, as long as proper credit is
	given. Think this program is awesome? You can buy me a beer. :P
- Any login detail is now accepted. I have seen this as the most common
	complaint. Don't know why I designed it like that.
