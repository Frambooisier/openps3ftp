OpenPS3FTP version 3.0 README
=============================

OpenPS3FTP is an open source FTP server for the PlayStation 3. It supports
the basic FTP commands that the typical user would need to transfer files
in and out of their console.

OpenPS3FTP is built using libraries from the PSL1GHT SDK.

=============================
What makes OpenPS3FTP stand out from the rest?
=============================

- Theoretically unlimited simultaneous transfers (depends on storage device)
- Open Source
- Greater stability when transferring multiple files
- Supports virtually all FTP clients
- Ability to change file permissions (SITE CHMOD, used by FileZilla)
- Supports transfer resuming
